# Archive Context - Implementation Details

This folder contains detailed implementation documentation that was moved from the main workspace to reduce context window usage.

## Contents

- **tasks_implementation_details.md** - Detailed TDD phases, test specifications, and implementation breakdowns from tasks.md
- **plan_implementation_details.md** - Verbose architecture descriptions, code patterns, and design details from plan.md

## Purpose

These files contain valuable implementation history and detailed specifications but are too verbose for day-to-day operational use. Future Claude instances should start with:

1. **CAPABILITIES.md** - What the system can do
2. **tasks.md** - Current status and active tasks (pruned)
3. **plan.md** - High-level architecture (pruned)

Then reference these archive files only when needed for specific implementation questions.

## Usage

Search these files when you need:
- Detailed test acceptance criteria
- Implementation patterns and code examples
- Historical context on design decisions
- Complete TDD workflow specifications
