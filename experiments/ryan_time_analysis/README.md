# Ryan Marien Time Analysis Experiment

## Overview
This is an isolated experimental analysis of Ryan Marien's time allocation patterns to identify opportunities for better focus and delegation. The experiment tests advanced analytics features that may be integrated into the main AICoS system.

## Hypothesis
Ryan has fallen into a "busy trap" characterized by:
- Over-scheduling with excessive context switching
- Frequent 15-minute meetings with high switching costs  
- Deep work blocks being overwritten by other meetings
- Lack of coherent weekly/quarterly priorities

## Data Sources
- **Calendar**: Full year of Google Calendar events (ryan@biorender.com)
- **Slack**: Activity patterns and communication density
- **Drive**: Document collaboration patterns

## Key Identifiers
- **Email**: ryan@biorender.com
- **Slack ID**: UBL74SKU0
- **Slack Name**: Ryan Marien
- **Calendar ID**: ryan@biorender.com

## Analysis Goals
1. **Context Switching Costs**: Quantify impact of fragmented schedule
2. **Deep Work Protection**: Measure success rate of protected time blocks
3. **Meeting Efficiency**: Identify consolidation and delegation opportunities
4. **Priority Coherence**: Track strategic vs operational time allocation
5. **Organizational Focus**: Map time distribution across teams/initiatives

## Experiment Structure
