## üéØ Using Your Priority Heatmap

### Understanding the Heatmap Layout

**3-Panel Structure:**
- **Left Panel:** Internal BioRender meetings (89.2% of your time)
- **Middle Panel:** Mixed Internal/External meetings (9.3% of your time)
- **Right Panel:** External-only meetings (1.5% of your time)

**Reading the Data:**
- **Y-Axis:** 7 topic categories (Leadership & Strategy at top, highest engagement)
- **X-Axis:** 25 weeks chronologically (Aug 2024 - Feb 2025)
- **Colors:** Heat intensity represents hours per week
- **Annotations:** Exact hours displayed in high-engagement cells

### Go-to-Market Insights (Your Focus Area)

**Internal GTM Pattern:**
- Consistent 2-4 hours weekly internal GTM focus
- Peak weeks: 2024-W41, 2024-W51, 2025-W02
- Strong internal team alignment on GTM initiatives

**Mixed GTM Pattern:**
- Peak collaboration: 3.5 hours in 2024-W41
- Cross-functional GTM work with external stakeholders
- Collaborative approach to customer and partner engagement

**External GTM Pattern:**
- Focused 0.5-1 hour weekly direct customer/partner meetings
- Efficient external GTM relationship management
- Strategic rather than operational external engagement

### Interpreting Weekly Patterns

**High Engagement Weeks:**
- 2024-W45: Peak Leadership & Strategy focus (potential strategic planning period)
- 2024-W41: Peak Go-to-Market collaboration (cross-segment project)
- 2024-W51: Year-end intensity across multiple topics

**Low Engagement Weeks:**
- 2025-W01: Holiday week natural reduction
- 2024-W44: Lower activity week (potential strategic break)
- Recovery patterns show quick return to baseline

## üìà Weekly Review Process

### Recommended Review Schedule

**Weekly (15 minutes every Friday):**
1. Compare current week engagement to heatmap patterns
2. Identify any significant deviations from established patterns
3. Note new collaboration patterns or partner changes
4. Plan following week adjustments based on historical data

**Monthly (30 minutes first Monday of month):**
1. Review month-over-month topic allocation changes
2. Compare segment distribution to baseline (89.2% internal target)
3. Assess whether current patterns align with business priorities
4. Identify optimization opportunities based on seasonal patterns

### Using the Provided Tracking Template

**Daily Executive Tracking Template** (`tools/daily_executive_tracking.csv`)

**How to Use:**
1. Open in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Log daily: meeting hours, topics, segments, and key insights
3. Weekly rollup: Compare to heatmap patterns
4. Monthly analysis: Identify trends and optimization opportunities

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Total meeting hours per week (target: maintain 21.4 hour average)
- Topic distribution (target: maintain 35% Leadership & Strategy)
- Segment balance (target: maintain 89% internal focus)
- Back-to-back meeting rate (target: maintain <5%)
