## Methodology Limitations

### Data Constraints

**Source Limitations:**
```
- Calendar data only (no communication content analysis)
- Meeting outcomes not captured
- Quality/effectiveness metrics unavailable
- Limited external relationship context
```

**Classification Limitations:**
```
- Conservative topic assignment (38% average confidence)
- Potential category overlap
- Meeting title-based inference only
- No meeting content analysis
```

**Temporal Limitations:**
```
- 25-week period (may not capture full annual patterns)
- Some weeks show potential data collection anomalies
- Holiday periods affect baseline patterns
- Seasonal variations not fully captured
```

### Statistical Considerations

**Confidence Intervals:**
```
- High confidence findings: 12.7% of events
- Medium confidence findings: 25.4% of events
- Low confidence findings: 61.9% of events
- Overall approach: Conservative classification preferred
```

**Data Anomalies Identified:**
```
- Week 2024-W45: 193.4 hours (flagged for review)
- Week 2024-W52: 349.3 hours (holiday week anomaly)
- Some peak weeks may contain collection errors
- Data quality decreases in holiday periods
```
