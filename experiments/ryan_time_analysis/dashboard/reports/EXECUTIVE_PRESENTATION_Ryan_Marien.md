## SLIDE 5: BUSY TRAP ANALYSIS
### Executive Effectiveness Scoring

**BUSY TRAP SCORE: 2.62/4.0 (HIGH RISK)**

**Risk Distribution (172 Days):**
- Severe Risk: **86 days (50%)**
- High Risk: 29 days (17%)
- Moderate Risk: 8 days (5%)
- Sustainable: Only 45 days (26%)

**KEY INDICATORS:**
- Meeting Overload: 65.1% of days
- Context Switching: 10.3 per day (target: <6)
- After-Hours Work: 33.2% (target: <20%)

---

## SLIDE 6: CORRELATION INSIGHTS
### What the Data Reveals

**CRITICAL CORRELATIONS DISCOVERED:**

1. **Total Collaboration â†” Busy Trap** (r = 0.89)
   - *More meetings = exponential productivity loss*

2. **Context Switching â†” Workload** (r = 0.82)
   - *Task switching destroys cognitive capacity*

3. **Meeting Volume â†” After-Hours** (r = 0.76)
   - *Meetings push work into personal time*

4. **Strategic Allocation â†” Control** (r = -0.73)
   - *Less strategic focus = less executive effectiveness*

**INSIGHT:** *Current collaboration pattern creates productivity death spiral*
