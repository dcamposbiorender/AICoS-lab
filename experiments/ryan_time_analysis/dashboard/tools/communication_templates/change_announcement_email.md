# Executive Effectiveness Optimization - Communication Template

## Subject: Important Changes to Ryan's Schedule and Communication Patterns

Dear [Team/Stakeholder Name],

I wanted to personally inform you of some important changes I'm implementing to my schedule and communication patterns, effective [DATE]. These changes are based on a comprehensive data analysis of my time allocation and are designed to enhance my strategic effectiveness and better serve our organization's goals.

### What's Changing:

**1. Protected Strategic Time (9-11 AM Daily)**
- This time is now reserved exclusively for strategic planning and deep work
- No meetings will be scheduled during this window
- Non-emergency communications will be addressed after 11 AM

**2. Meeting Optimization**
- Reducing meeting frequency and duration through delegation and efficiency improvements
- Implementing mandatory agendas and preparation requirements
- Focusing on decision-oriented rather than information-sharing meetings

**3. Communication Boundaries** 
- After-hours communications (after 7 PM) limited to true emergencies
- Response times may be longer as I batch similar communications
- Increased delegation to direct reports for operational matters

### What This Means for You:

**If you typically meet with me regularly:**
- Some meetings may be delegated to my direct reports who have full authority to make decisions
- Remaining meetings will have stricter time boundaries and preparation requirements
- Alternative meeting times will be offered if you previously had 9-11 AM slots

**If you need decisions or input:**
- Consider whether this requires my unique executive authority or can be handled by my team
- For urgent matters, please clearly indicate the business impact and time sensitivity
- For strategic discussions, I'll now have better protected time to give thoughtful attention

### Why These Changes:

Recent analysis showed I was spending 17.7 hours per day on collaboration activities, with only 17% of my time focused on strategic work. This pattern is unsustainable and doesn't serve our organization's need for strategic leadership. These changes will allow me to:

- Increase strategic focus from 17% to 60% of my time
- Provide higher quality attention when we do interact
- Develop stronger team autonomy and decision-making capability
- Make faster, better-informed decisions on critical matters

### Support During Transition:

My EA [NAME] and direct reports are fully briefed on these changes and authorized to:
- Reschedule meetings as needed
- Handle meeting requests and calendar coordination
- Provide alternative solutions for routine matters
- Escalate truly urgent issues that require my immediate attention

### Emergency Protocol:

True emergencies (customer crisis, legal issues, major competitive threats) will always receive immediate attention. Please contact [EA NAME] at [CONTACT] with clear justification for emergency status.

I appreciate your understanding and support during this transition. These changes will ultimately allow me to be more effective in my strategic role and better serve all of our stakeholders.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to [EA NAME] with any questions about how these changes might affect your specific interactions with me.

Best regards,
Ryan Marien
