# Auto-Response Template for Meeting Requests

## Subject: RE: Meeting Request - Optimization Guidelines

Thank you for your meeting request. As part of an executive effectiveness optimization initiative, I've implemented new guidelines for meeting scheduling to ensure the most valuable use of everyone's time.

### Before We Schedule:

Please consider these alternatives first:
1. **Can this be handled asynchronously?** Email or Slack may be more efficient for information sharing or simple decisions.
2. **Can my direct report handle this?** [List relevant direct reports and their areas of authority]
3. **Is this truly strategic?** If it's operational, my team likely has full authority to decide and act.

### If a meeting is necessary:

**Required for all meeting requests:**
- [ ] **Clear objective:** What specific decision or outcome is needed?
- [ ] **Agenda:** Detailed agenda provided 24 hours in advance
- [ ] **Preparation materials:** Any documents/context sent 48 hours ahead
- [ ] **Duration justification:** Why does this need the time requested?
- [ ] **Attendee necessity:** Confirmation that all attendees are essential

**Scheduling guidelines:**
- **Protected time:** 9-11 AM daily is reserved for strategic work (emergencies only)
- **Preferred duration:** 25 minutes (instead of 30) or 45 minutes (instead of 60)
- **Maximum attendees:** 6 people unless I'm presenting to a larger group
- **Advance notice:** Minimum 48 hours for non-urgent matters

### Alternative Options:

1. **Direct Report Meetings:** 
   - Alex Chen (Product): [email] - Product roadmap, feature decisions, development coordination
   - Sarah Kim (Operations): [email] - Process optimization, team coordination, operational metrics
   
2. **Async Communication:**
   - Strategic questions: Email with 24-48 hour response time
   - Quick decisions: Slack with context and clear ask
   - Information sharing: Email updates or shared documents

3. **Communication Office Hours:**
   - Daily: 2-3 PM for non-urgent Slack discussions
   - Weekly: [Day] [Time] for open consultation

### Emergency Meetings:

If this is truly urgent (customer crisis, legal issue, major competitive threat), please:
1. Contact my EA [NAME] at [PHONE/EMAIL]
2. Clearly state the emergency nature and business impact
3. Provide 2-3 alternative time slots within 24 hours

### Next Steps:

If your request meets the above criteria and requires my unique executive input, please reply with:
- Updated agenda meeting the requirements above
- 3 preferred time slots outside 9-11 AM
- Confirmation that alternatives have been considered

I appreciate your understanding. These changes allow me to provide higher quality strategic attention when we do meet.

Best regards,
Ryan's EA Team
