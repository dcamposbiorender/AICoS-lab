In July, we\u2019re now seeing *churn slightly outpace new MRR*, which brings our *quick ratio to 0.92*.\nNot a crisis, needs further monitoring but definitely something we want to stay ahead of. We're starting to explore *some light-touch levers* (e.g., campaigns, limited discounts, refreshed messaging) to support the *SS Academic segment*, which is especially price-sensitive right now. And I'll be looping in teams accordingly.\n\nMore to come as we pressure-test a few ideas \u2014 and always open to input.

It is a top-line-only build to get us to ~$200M ARR in 3 years and show ~40% YoY growth for FY26. (It's one of those \"let's plug in the retention/ACV/new logo assumptions we need in order to get a 3x\" type of build....non-intellectually driven)\n\u2022 the *full company operating model* is something our external CFO team (Henry + Kelly) have started and I'll be connecting with them tomorrow to walk through what has been built so far and start the handoff process \nThat being said, about a month ago, we worked on a *\"Cost Allocation\" build* to get a sense of \"true\" Gross Margins and $CAC. These numbers will need to be updated slightly (for the latest FS and SS ARR waterfalls and updated for Q1'FY26 financials). Would an updated version of this attached Excel help answer the question on \"max cash funded growth rate\" at various CAC degradation?",

In July, we\u2019re now seeing *churn slightly outpace new MRR*, which brings our *quick ratio to 0.92*.\nNot a crisis, needs further monitoring but definitely something we want to stay ahead of. We're starting to explore *some light-touch levers* (e.g., campaigns, limited discounts, refreshed messaging) to support the *SS Academic segment*, which is especially price-sensitive right now. And I'll be looping in teams accordingly.\n\nMore to come as we pressure-test a few ideas \u2014 and always open to input.

          "text": "<@U08VDD7QXL6> regarding your #2 ask, can definitely share excel/backup to anything I'm working on--if ok, can I get back to you early next week on this? For transparency:\n\u2022 the WYHTB *\"What you have to believe model\"* is an external investor-facing model we're currently making adjustments to. It is a top-line-only build to get us to ~$200M ARR in 3 years and show ~40% YoY growth for FY26. (It's one of those \"let's plug in the retention/ACV/new logo assumptions we need in order to get a 3x\" type of build....non-intellectually driven)\n\u2022 the *full company operating model* is something our external CFO team (Henry + Kelly) have started and I'll be connecting with them tomorrow to walk through what has been built so far and start the handoff process \nThat being said, about a month ago, we worked on a *\"Cost Allocation\" build* to get a sense of \"true\" Gross Margins and $CAC. These numbers will need to be updated slightly (for the latest FS and SS ARR waterfalls and updated for Q1'FY26 financials). Would an updated version of this attached Excel help answer the question on \"max cash funded growth rate\" at various CAC degradation?",

Was going to make in in my personal drive but that is bad hygiene\n\nTwo off the top of my head - with the file will go adding more\n1. With Jenn discussed a perplexity/antropic/chatGPT scan of adjacencies and pricing (where are people paying today, and what - like prism)\n2. <@U08L6S1USAY> mind sharing the excel? I'm curious what 'max cash funded growth rate' the company spits out if you burn the entire cashflow on GTM (assuming 0-30% degradation in CAC efficiency) ",

In July, we\u2019re now seeing *churn slightly outpace new MRR*, which brings our *quick ratio to 0.92*.\nNot a crisis, needs further monitoring but definitely something we want to stay ahead of. We're starting to explore *some light-touch levers* (e.g., campaigns, limited discounts, refreshed messaging) to support the *SS Academic segment*, which is especially price-sensitive right now. And I'll be looping in teams accordingly.\n\nMore to come as we pressure-test a few ideas \u2014 and always open to input.

For transparency:\n\u2022 the WYHTB *\"What you have to believe model\"* is an external investor-facing model we're currently making adjustments to. It is a top-line-only build to get us to ~$200M ARR in 3 years and show ~40% YoY growth for FY26. (It's one of those \"let's plug in the retention/ACV/new logo assumptions we need in order to get a 3x\" type of build....non-intellectually driven)\n\u2022 the *full company operating model* is something our external CFO team (Henry + Kelly) have started and I'll be connecting with them tomorrow to walk through what has been built so far and start the handoff process \nThat being said, about a month ago, we worked on a *\"Cost Allocation\" build* to get a sense of \"true\" Gross Margins and $CAC. These numbers will need to be updated slightly (for the latest FS and SS ARR waterfalls and updated for Q1'FY26 financials). Would an updated version of this attached Excel help answer the question on \"max cash funded growth rate\" at various CAC degradation?",
