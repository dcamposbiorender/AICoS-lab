# David's Workstream Analysis: Where to Spend Your Time

**Analysis Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Data Sources:** 339,820 Slack messages, 269 calendar meetings, 246 Drive documents

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your current time allocation is **heavily skewed toward GTM Efficiency (66.8%)** with significant gaps in other strategic workstreams. While GTM is important, you're missing critical opportunities in Cost Optimization, ICP Expansion, and AI transformation.

### Current vs. Target Allocation:
- **GTM Efficiency**: 66.8% ‚úÖ (Well-allocated for high priority)  
- **Executive**: 20.7% ‚úÖ (Appropriate for leadership role)
- **Cost Optimization**: 0.0% ‚ùå (Should be 25-40% - CRITICAL GAP)
- **Data Platform**: 4.5% ‚ùå (Should be 10-25%)
- **AI Transformation**: 7.9% ‚ùå (Should be 10-25%)  
- **ICP Expansion**: 0.0% ‚ùå (Should be 10-25%)
- **AI BizOps Team**: 0.0% ‚ùå (Should be 10-25%)

## üö® CRITICAL INSIGHTS

1. **MASSIVE GAP in Cost Optimization**: Your #1 stated goal is to "reduce cost base by $2M+" but you have 0% time allocation here. This is a strategic misalignment.

2. **GTM Over-Optimization**: 66.8% on GTM Efficiency suggests you may be getting pulled into operational details rather than strategic initiatives.

3. **Strong Data Platform Relationship**: Your most active Slack conversation is with Adam Shapiro (531 messages), but only 4.5% calendar time. Opportunity to leverage this relationship more.

4. **Document Activity Mismatch**: 169 GTM documents vs. only 14 Data Platform documents suggests document creation/review patterns align with time spent.

**Bottom Line:** Your data shows you're operationally focused (GTM) when you need to be strategically focused (Cost, ICP, AI). The analysis reveals strong relationships (Adam Shapiro) and active work streams (119 recent documents) that you can leverage to rebalance toward your stated strategic goals.

The path forward is clear: reduce GTM tactical time, increase strategic initiative time, and leverage your existing stakeholder relationships to accelerate progress on under-allocated workstreams.
