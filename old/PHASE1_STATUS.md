- **Maintainability**: Clear organization and development guidelines

## Current Limitations

### Development Areas
1. **Drive Integration**: Metadata collection only (content extraction planned)
2. **AI Features**: Phase 2+ components are placeholder implementations
3. **Performance**: Benchmarking in progress, not yet validated at scale
4. **Documentation**: Some setup and operational guides incomplete

### Known Issues
1. **Configuration**: Setup requires manual credential configuration
2. **Testing**: Some integration tests require live API access
3. **Performance**: Large-scale performance characteristics not yet validated
4. **Documentation**: Installation and deployment guides need completion

## Next Development Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete setup and installation documentation
2. Resolve configuration and credential management
3. Validate performance characteristics with realistic data
4. Complete integration test coverage

### Medium-term Goals
1. Enhance Drive content extraction capabilities
2. Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Add comprehensive monitoring and logging
4. Develop deployment and operational procedures

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Approach
- **Philosophy**: Test-driven development with comprehensive validation
- **Coverage**: All major components have corresponding test coverage
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance**: Response time and throughput monitoring

### Standards Compliance
- **Code Quality**: Consistent patterns and documentation standards
- **Security**: Local-first storage with encrypted credential management
- **Reliability**: Circuit breakers, retry logic, and graceful error handling
- **Maintainability**: Clear architecture and development guidelines

This status reflects the current state of implementation and provides realistic expectations for system capabilities and development roadmap.
