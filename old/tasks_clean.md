# Stage 3: Search Infrastructure (Parallel Development Plans)

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Approach**: Independent parallel development using mock data while credentials are being fixed  
**Teams**: 3 teams × 3 sub-agents = 9 parallel developers

## Executive Summary

With credential testing blocked, we can build the search infrastructure (Stage 3) independently using mock data. This creates a complete search system that can index and query JSONL archives without requiring API credentials. The three teams focus on: Database & Search (Team A), Archive Management (Team B), and Query Engine & Intelligence (Team C).

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Task Plans Subsegmented

**The detailed Stage 3 implementation plans have been moved to separate files for better context management:**

### 📁 Team-Specific Implementation Files:

1. **[`tasks_A.md`](tasks_A.md)** - Team A: Database & Search Implementation
   - SQLite FTS5 database with lab-grade optimizations
   - Indexing pipeline with batch processing and streaming
   - Search CLI with natural language query support
   - **~1600 lines** of detailed tests and implementation code
   - **Timeline**: 8 hours (3 database + 3 indexing + 2 CLI)

2. **[`tasks_B.md`](tasks_B.md)** - Team B: Archive Management Systems
   - Safe compression with atomic operations and backup protection
   - Enhanced verification with schema validation and resume capability
   - User-friendly management CLI with progress indicators
   - **~1200 lines** of detailed tests and implementation code
   - **Timeline**: 3-4 hours with critical safety features

3. **`tasks_C.md`** - Team C: Query Engine & Intelligence *(Not yet defined)*
   - Advanced query parsing and natural language processing
   - Time-based and person-based query engines
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Intelligence layer for pattern recognition

### 📋 Quick Team Summary:

**Team A Focus**: SQLite FTS5 search infrastructure
- **Lab-Grade Fixes Applied**: Batch processing, corrected schema, streaming
- **Production Ready**: 90% for lab, 70% for multi-user production

**Team B Focus**: Archive management and compression
- **Critical Safety Fixes Applied**: Atomic operations, backup protection, concurrency safety
- **Production Ready**: 95% for lab, 80% for production (excellent safety record)

**Team C Focus**: Query engines and intelligence *(deferred until Teams A & B complete)*
- **Dependencies**: Requires completed search infrastructure from Team A
- **Timeline**: Begin after Team A delivers working SQLite FTS5 system

### 🔗 Context Management Benefits:

1. **Reduced Context Overhead**: Each team file is ~800-1600 lines vs 3800+ in single file
2. **Parallel Development**: Teams can work independently without context conflicts  
3. **Specialized Focus**: Each file contains only relevant code patterns and examples
4. **Better Agent Performance**: Agents can load only necessary context for their specific tasks

## Team Coordination & Architecture Overview

### Shared Components (Cross-Team Dependencies)

**Database Schema** (Team A → Teams B & C):
```sql
-- Core tables that all teams will use
CREATE TABLE messages (id, content, source, timestamp, metadata);
CREATE TABLE events (id, title, start_time, attendees, metadata);
CREATE TABLE files (id, name, path, modified_time, metadata);
```

**Archive Format** (Teams A & B):
```json
// Standardized JSONL format for all data types
{"type": "message", "timestamp": "2025-08-17T10:30:00Z", "content": "...", "metadata": {...}}
{"type": "event", "timestamp": "2025-08-17T14:00:00Z", "content": "Meeting...", "metadata": {...}}
```

### Integration Points

1. **Team A → Team B**: Search database writes to Team B's compressed archives
2. **Team A → Team C**: FTS5 search results feed Team C's query processing
3. **Team B → Team A**: Archive verification ensures database integrity
4. **Team C → Teams A&B**: Intelligence queries require both search and archive access

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Raw JSONL Archives (Stage 1c Complete)
    ↓
[Team B] Archive Management → Compression, Verification, Statistics  
    ↓
[Team A] Database & Indexing → SQLite FTS5, Search Pipeline
    ↓
[Team C] Query Engine → Natural Language, Time-based, Person-based Queries
    ↓
Search Results & Insights
```

### Success Criteria for Stage 3

**Team A Success**:
- ✅ SQLite database can index 10k+ messages in <30 seconds
- ✅ Full-text search returns results in <500ms
- ✅ CLI search interface works with natural language queries
- ✅ Batch processing handles large JSONL files without memory issues

**Team B Success**:
- ✅ Safe compression reduces archive size by >60% without data loss
- ✅ Verification detects corruption and missing data with 100% accuracy  
- ✅ CLI provides progress indicators and ETA for long operations
- ✅ All operations are atomic and safe for concurrent access

**Team C Success** *(Future)*:
- ✅ Natural language queries ("meetings last week with John")
- ✅ Time-based filtering ("messages from yesterday") 
- ✅ Person-based aggregation ("all files shared by Sarah")
- ✅ Intelligence insights ("commitments not yet completed")

**Overall Stage 3 Success**:
- ✅ Complete search infrastructure replaces current manual data hunting
- ✅ Query response time <5 seconds for typical executive queries
- ✅ System handles 6+ months of data (estimated 50k+ messages, 1k+ events)
- ✅ Zero data loss through all operations
- ✅ Ready for Stage 4 intelligence layer development
