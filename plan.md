# AI Chief of Staff Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a comprehensive AI-powered personal assistant that maintains organizational context, tracks informal commitments, and coordinates action for remote leadership teams.

**Core Architecture**: Progressive enhancement model where Phase 1 establishes deterministic data foundation, then Phases 2+ add LLM intelligence to achieve full vision.

**Success Criteria**:
- 14 consecutive days of daily usage
- Reduce context hunting from 30-60min to â‰¤10min/day
- Track â‰¥80% of meeting commitments
- â‰¥3 meetings/week scheduled via bot
- Zero hallucinated facts (all data traceable to source)

## Current Status (August 28, 2025)

### âœ… **Phase 1: Deterministic Foundation - COMPLETE**
**Completion Date**: August 19, 2025
- Data collection from Slack, Calendar, Drive (340,071 records indexed)
- Full-text search with <2 second response times
- Calendar coordination and statistics generation
- Complete CLI tooling with 907 tests passing
- Migration system with database versioning

### ðŸ”„ **Phase 4.5: Lab-Grade Frontend Dashboard - IN PROGRESS**
**Target**: Real-time dashboard with paper-dense aesthetic
- Backend API with WebSocket broadcasting
- Browser-based dashboard with keyboard navigation
- C1/P1/M1 coding system for rapid interaction
- Slack bot integration with shared state

### ðŸ“‹ **Phase 6: User-Centric Architecture - QUEUED**
**Target**: Transform system to recognize PRIMARY_USER
- Comprehensive setup wizard for first-time configuration
- User identity configuration across all systems
- Personalized dashboard and briefings
- Simple lab-grade implementation

## High-Level Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Deterministic Foundation âœ…
Established reliable data collection, search, and coordination without AI dependencies. All operations are deterministic and auditable.

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
Add LLM-powered commitment extraction, goal tracking, and briefing generation while maintaining deterministic fallbacks.

### Phase 3: Memory Architecture
**DECISION**: Skipped in favor of simpler caching and preference learning approaches.

### Phase 4: Slack Bot Integration 
Basic slash commands exposing Phase 1 functionality through secure Slack interface.

### Phase 4.5: Frontend Dashboard (Active)
Real-time dashboard with WebSocket synchronization, keyboard-driven interface, and integration with existing backend.

### Phase 5: Scale & Optimization
Production performance optimization for multi-user deployment.

### Phase 6: User-Centric Architecture (Queued)
Simple personalization recognizing primary user with comprehensive setup wizard.

## Architecture Principles

### Deterministic Foundation, Intelligent Enhancement
- Phase 1 provides complete value without AI
- Higher phases add intelligence with graceful degradation
- All AI insights traceable to source data
- Zero tolerance for hallucinated facts

### Local-First, Audit-First
- Comprehensive data collection and preservation
- Complete audit trails from insight to source
- Local processing with no external dependencies
- Immutable data storage with change tracking

## Next Actions

1. **Complete Phase 4.5 Frontend Dashboard** (5 frontend agent tasks)
2. **Begin Phase 6 User-Centric Setup** (3 personalization agent tasks)
3. **Consider Phase 4 Slack Bot** based on usage patterns
