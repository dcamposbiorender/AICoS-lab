# Progress.md - AI Chief of Staff Implementation Plan

The purpose of this file is to keep track of the overall progress and master plan of the project.

> **Note**: Task plans have been split into separate files for better context management during parallel development. See subsegmentation note at the end of this document.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a comprehensive AI-powered personal assistant that maintains organizational context, tracks informal commitments, and coordinates action for remote leadership teams.

**Core Architecture**: Progressive enhancement model where Phase 1 establishes deterministic data foundation, then Phases 2+ add LLM intelligence to achieve full vision. LLM acts as intelligent layer over deterministic tools that process all data and maintain complete audit trails.

**Success Criteria**:
- 14 consecutive days of daily usage
- Reduce context hunting from 30-60min to ≤10min/day
- Track ≥80% of meeting commitments
- ≥3 meetings/week scheduled via bot
- Zero hallucinated facts (all data traceable to source)

## Architectural Paradigm

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

The system is built in explicit phases:

**Phase 1 - Deterministic Foundation**:
- Complete data collection and storage
- Full-text search and indexing
- Basic calendar coordination
- Time-based queries and retrieval
- Structured extraction (dates, @mentions, tags)

**Phase 2+ - Intelligence Layers**:
- LLM-powered commitment extraction
- Goal tracking and status inference
- Intelligent briefing generation
- Sentiment analysis and urgency detection
- Predictive nudging and recommendations

### Core Principle: Deterministic Foundation, Intelligent Enhancement

Phase 1 establishes trust through:
1. **Complete Collection**: Capture all data deterministically
2. **Perfect Recall**: Every piece of data searchable and retrievable
3. **Transparent Operations**: All operations explainable without AI
4. **Immediate Value**: Solve context hunting without magic

Phases 2+ add intelligence with:
1. **Semantic Understanding**: Extract meaning from natural language
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends and anomalies
3. **Predictive Capabilities**: Anticipate needs and deadlines
4. **Human Validation**: Confirm all AI-extracted insights

All phases maintain:
- Complete audit trails from insight to source
- Deterministic data storage and retrieval
- Human approval for external actions
- Zero tolerance for hallucinated facts

- **Standardized Collectors**: All collectors (Slack, Calendar, Drive, Employee) inherit from unified base
- **Architecture Cleanup**: Eliminated duplicate code, removed confusing wrapper layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Collectors work with or without full framework (testing friendly)

#### Major Architecture Changes (August 2025)
- **scavenge/ Directory**: Completely removed - eliminated ~5500 lines of duplicate/confusing code  
- **Wrapper Classes**: Deleted misleading wrappers that claimed to wrap scavenge but wrapped local code
- **State Management**: Upgraded from file-based to SQLite for better concurrency and transaction support
- **Collector Inheritance**: All collectors now properly inherit from BaseArchiveCollector with consistent interface

#### Still Pending (As Planned)
- **Search Infrastructure**: SQLite FTS5 implementation for full-text search (Stage 3)
- **Query Engines**: Time-based and person-based queries (Stage 4)
- **Management Tools**: Data lifecycle and compression tools (Stage 1c)

### Acceptable for Lab Use

For single-user lab testing, these limitations are acceptable:

1. **State Management Race Conditions**
   - Impact: None for single user
   - Fix needed for: Multi-user production

2. **Missing Search Infrastructure**

3. **Enhance Collectors**: Either wrap scavenge properly or add rate limiting
4. **Fix Failing Tests**: Address edge cases for production resilience
5. **Add Missing Components**: Drive wrapper, query engines, aggregators

### Development Approach

Given lab-grade context:
- **Proceed to Stage 1c** (Management & Compression tools)
- **Use system as-is** for testing and experimentation
- **Identify actual needs** through usage
- **Enhance incrementally** based on real requirements
- **Don't over-engineer** for theoretical scenarios

## Current Status

**Phase**: Stages 1a & 1b-2 Complete (Lab-Grade)
**Next Task**: Stage 1c - Management & Compression Tools (optional) OR Stage 3 - Search & Indexing  
**Progress**: ~85% of Phase 1 foundation complete

**Current State**:
- ✅ Core infrastructure complete with SQLite state management
- ✅ All collectors standardized with BaseArchiveCollector inheritance
- ✅ Architecture cleanup complete (~5500 lines of duplicate code eliminated)
- ✅ Integration tests passing, new architecture validated
- 🔄 Ready for either management tools (Stage 1c) or search implementation (Stage 3)

**Completed Architecture Improvements**:
- Unified BaseArchiveCollector providing retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
- SQLite-based state management with proper concurrency support
- Standardized collector interfaces across all data sources
- Comprehensive authentication system with unified credential management
- JSONL archive system with atomic write operations

**Focus**: Complete Phase 1 with management tools, then enhance based on actual usage experience

## Stage 3: Search & Indexing Implementation Plan

### Executive Summary
Implement SQLite FTS5-based search infrastructure to enable fast, deterministic full-text search across all collected data (Slack, Calendar, Drive). This provides immediate value through unified search without requiring any AI/LLM capabilities.

### Stage 3 Sub-Stages

#### Stage 3a: Search Infrastructure Foundation (3 hours)
**Objective**: Establish SQLite FTS5 database with schema for multi-source search

**Task 3a.1: Database Schema & Connection Management (45 minutes)**
- Create `src/search/database.py` with connection pooling
- Design unified schema for Slack, Calendar, Drive data
- Implement database initialization and migration system
- Add proper connection cleanup and error handling

**Task 3a.2: FTS5 Configuration & Optimization (45 minutes)**
- Configure FTS5 tokenizers for optimal search
- Set up porter stemming for better matching
- Implement ranking functions for relevance scoring
- Add support for phrase and proximity searches

**Task 3a.3: Multi-Source Schema Integration (45 minutes)**
- Create tables for each data source with appropriate columns
- Implement virtual tables for FTS5 searching
- Add metadata columns for filtering (date, person, source)
- Set up indexes for common query patterns

**Task 3a.4: Search Infrastructure Testing (45 minutes)**
- Unit tests for database operations
- Performance tests with sample datasets
- Verify FTS5 features (stemming, ranking, phrases)
- Test connection pooling under load

**Test Acceptance Criteria**:
- Database initializes correctly with all tables
- FTS5 searches return results in <100ms for 10K records
- Connection pool handles concurrent queries
- All search operators work (AND, OR, phrase, proximity)

#### Stage 3b: Indexing Engine (3 hours)
**Objective**: Build incremental indexing system for efficient data ingestion

**Task 3b.1: Base Indexer Implementation (45 minutes)**
- Create `src/search/indexer.py` with BaseIndexer class
- Implement batch processing for JSONL archives
- Add transaction management for atomic updates
- Create progress tracking and resumability

**Task 3b.2: Source-Specific Indexers (45 minutes)**
- SlackIndexer: Extract searchable fields from messages
- CalendarIndexer: Index event titles, descriptions, attendees
- DriveIndexer: Index file names, paths, change metadata
- Handle source-specific data transformations

**Task 3b.3: Incremental Indexing Logic (45 minutes)**
- Implement change detection using checksums
- Create incremental update strategy
- Add deduplication logic
- Implement deletion and update handling

**Task 3b.4: Indexing Pipeline Testing (45 minutes)**
- Test indexing with real JSONL samples
- Verify incremental updates work correctly
- Test error recovery and resumability
- Measure indexing performance (records/second)

**Test Acceptance Criteria**:
- Indexes 1000 records/second minimum
- Incremental updates only process changed data
- Deduplication prevents duplicate entries
- Pipeline resumes correctly after failures

#### Stage 3c: Search Query Engine & CLI (2 hours)
**Objective**: Create powerful search interface with natural query support

**Task 3c.1: Query Parser & Builder (30 minutes)**

- Handle complex boolean queries

**Task 3c.2: Search Result Processing (30 minutes)**
- Implement result ranking and scoring
- Add snippet extraction with highlighting
- Create result aggregation across sources
- Format results with source attribution

**Task 3c.3: Search CLI Tool (30 minutes)**
- Create `tools/search_data.py` CLI
- Support interactive and batch modes
- Add output formatting (JSON, table, markdown)
- Include filter and sort options

**Task 3c.4: End-to-End Testing (30 minutes)**
- Integration tests with sample data
- Test various query patterns
- Verify result accuracy and relevance
