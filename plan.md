# Progress.md - AI Chief of Staff Implementation Plan

The purpose of this file is to keep track of the overall progress and master plan of the project.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a comprehensive AI-powered personal assistant that maintains organizational context, tracks informal commitments, and coordinates action for remote leadership teams.

**Core Architecture**: Progressive enhancement model where Phase 1 establishes deterministic data foundation, then Phases 2+ add LLM intelligence to achieve full vision. LLM acts as intelligent layer over deterministic tools that process all data and maintain complete audit trails.

**Success Criteria**:
- 14 consecutive days of daily usage
- Reduce context hunting from 30-60min to ≤10min/day
- Track ≥80% of meeting commitments
- ≥3 meetings/week scheduled via bot
- Zero hallucinated facts (all data traceable to source)

## Architectural Paradigm

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

The system is built in explicit phases:

**Phase 1 - Deterministic Foundation**:
- Complete data collection and storage
- Full-text search and indexing
- Basic calendar coordination
- Time-based queries and retrieval
- Structured extraction (dates, @mentions, tags)

**Phase 2+ - Intelligence Layers**:
- LLM-powered commitment extraction
- Goal tracking and status inference
- Intelligent briefing generation
- Sentiment analysis and urgency detection
- Predictive nudging and recommendations

### Core Principle: Deterministic Foundation, Intelligent Enhancement

Phase 1 establishes trust through:
1. **Complete Collection**: Capture all data deterministically
2. **Perfect Recall**: Every piece of data searchable and retrievable
3. **Transparent Operations**: All operations explainable without AI
4. **Immediate Value**: Solve context hunting without magic

Phases 2+ add intelligence with:
1. **Semantic Understanding**: Extract meaning from natural language
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends and anomalies
3. **Predictive Capabilities**: Anticipate needs and deadlines
4. **Human Validation**: Confirm all AI-extracted insights

All phases maintain:
- Complete audit trails from insight to source
- Deterministic data storage and retrieval
- Human approval for external actions
- Zero tolerance for hallucinated facts

- Search accuracy
- Calendar math correctness
- Data integrity
- State persistence

**Phase 2+ Tests (Intelligence)**
- Extraction accuracy against golden dataset
- Confidence threshold validation
- Source attribution presence
- Fallback to Phase 1 features

## Known Limitations (Lab-Grade Implementation)

**Context**: This is a lab-grade implementation for single-user testing. The architecture supports future scaling, but current implementation has known limitations that are acceptable for experimental use.

### Current Implementation Status (2025-08-15)

#### Stage 1a: Core Infrastructure ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
- **Config Management**: Working with environment-based configuration
- **Archive Writer**: Fully functional JSONL writing with daily directories
- **State Management**: Working for single-user (has race conditions under concurrent load)
- **Test Coverage**: 96% pass rate (177/184 tests passing)

#### Stage 1b: Collector Wrappers ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- **Base Collector**: Abstract class implemented with retry logic and circuit breaker
- **Simplified Collectors**: Basic implementations exist (not wrapping scavenge as planned)
- **Missing Integration**: Collectors don't integrate with sophisticated scavenge features
- **No Drive Wrapper**: Drive collector not implemented

#### Not Implemented Yet
- **Search Infrastructure**: No SQLite FTS5 implementation (can grep JSONL files for now)
- **Query Engines**: Time-based and person-based queries not built
- **Scavenge Integration**: Wrappers don't actually wrap existing collectors

### Acceptable for Lab Use

For single-user lab testing, these limitations are acceptable:

1. **State Management Race Conditions**
   - Impact: None for single user
   - Fix needed for: Multi-user production

2. **Missing Search Infrastructure**
   - Workaround: grep/search JSONL files directly
   - Fix needed for: Efficient queries at scale

3. **Simplified Collectors**
   - Current: Basic data collection without rate limiting
   - Sufficient for: Lab testing with low API volume
   - Fix needed for: Production API usage

4. **No Scavenge Integration**
   - Current: Simple collectors instead of sophisticated wrappers
   - Sufficient for: Basic data collection
   - Fix needed for: Advanced features (discovery, analytics)

5. **Failing Tests (7 of 184)**
   - Failures: Edge cases (permissions, disk full, concurrent access)
   - Impact: None in controlled lab environment
   - Fix needed for: Production resilience

### Architecture Strengths (Ready for Future Scaling)

Despite limitations, the implementation has good foundations:
- ✅ Clean abstractions and interfaces
- ✅ Atomic operations for data integrity
- ✅ JSONL archive format for easy processing
- ✅ Circuit breaker pattern for API resilience
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (96%)
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ Extensible collector base class

### Migration Path to Production

When ready to scale beyond lab use:

1. **Replace State Management**: Use SQLite with WAL mode for proper concurrency
2. **Implement Search**: Add SQLite FTS5 for efficient full-text search
3. **Enhance Collectors**: Either wrap scavenge properly or add rate limiting
4. **Fix Failing Tests**: Address edge cases for production resilience
5. **Add Missing Components**: Drive wrapper, query engines, aggregators

### Development Approach

Given lab-grade context:
- **Proceed to Stage 1c** (Management & Compression tools)
- **Use system as-is** for testing and experimentation
- **Identify actual needs** through usage
- **Enhance incrementally** based on real requirements
- **Don't over-engineer** for theoretical scenarios

## Current Status

**Phase**: Stage 1a & 1b Implemented (Lab-Grade)
**Next Task**: Stage 1c - Management & Compression Tools  
**Progress**: ~75% of Phase 1 foundation complete

**Current State**:
- Core infrastructure working for single-user lab use
- Basic data collection functional
- Archive storage system operational
- Management tools needed for data lifecycle

**Available Assets from scavenge/**:
- Sophisticated rate limiting with jitter (for future use)
- Comprehensive authentication system (partially integrated)
- Working collectors for Slack, Calendar, Drive (as reference)
- Error handling and retry patterns (extracted into new code)
- State management infrastructure (patterns reused)

**Focus**: Complete Phase 1 with management tools, then enhance based on actual usage experience

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with existing scavenge/ code
2. Create contract test suite for tool outputs
3. Wrap existing collectors with JSON output methods
4. Implement full-text search and indexing
5. Build basic calendar coordination
6. Create CLI tools for Phase 1 operations
7. Test deterministic pipeline end-to-end
8. Validate Phase 1 value with users
9. Plan Phase 2 intelligence features based on feedback
10. Continue progressive enhancement through all phases

## Phase 1 Execution Plan (2025-08-15)

### Executive Summary
Build a deterministic data collection and search foundation by wrapping existing scavenge/ collectors, adding full-text search/indexing, implementing query engines, and creating an archive storage system. This provides immediate value through unified search across all data sources without requiring any AI/LLM capabilities.

### Key Implementation Details

#### Architecture Approach: Start Clean with Pattern Reuse
- **Collectors**: Build new implementations using learned rate limiting patterns
- **Authentication**: Single credential source with validation, inspired by vault concept
- **State Management**: New atomic operations using temp file + rename pattern
- **Rate Limiting**: Extract SlackRateLimiter logic into reusable component
- **Configuration**: Environment-based with startup validation

#### Concrete Component Specifications
1. **Search Engine**: SQLite FTS5 with incremental indexing for portability
2. **Query Parsers**: Natural date parsing, person resolution across sources
3. **Archive Manager**: Daily JSONL with gzip, 90-day hot + compressed cold storage
4. **Extractors**: Regex patterns for @mentions, TODO/DEADLINE, dates
5. **Aggregators**: Statistical summaries (counts, frequencies, coverage)
6. **Circuit Breaker**: API failure protection with auto-recovery
7. **Checkpoint System**: Resume long operations from failures

#### Data Flow
1. Collectors → Raw JSONL archives (append-only)
2. Archives → Search indices (rebuilt periodically)
3. Archives → Query engines (real-time retrieval)
4. Query results → JSON output for orchestrator
5. Aggregators → Processed facts storage

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test each extractor pattern individually
- Verify query parsers handle edge cases
- Test aggregation calculations

#### Integration Tests
- End-to-end collection → archive → search flow
- Cross-source person queries
- Calendar coordination scenarios

#### User Acceptance Criteria
- Can find any Slack message by keyword
- Can retrieve all activity for a person
- Can find meeting slots in <10 seconds
- Daily summaries accurately reflect activity

### Risk Mitigation
- **Search Performance**: Use incremental indexing, not full rebuilds
- **Storage Growth**: Implement compression and rotation early
- **Query Complexity**: Start simple, enhance incrementally
- **Calendar Edge Cases**: Handle timezones defensively

### Success Metrics
- Search response time <2 seconds
- Query accuracy >95%
- Zero data loss incidents
- Collection completeness 100%
- All operations work without LLM

## Critical Architecture Decisions

### Code Reuse Strategy: Start Clean with Pattern Extraction
**Decision**: Build new implementations rather than wrap existing scavenge/ code
**Rationale**: Existing codebase has architectural inconsistencies and tight coupling
**Approach**: Extract valuable patterns (rate limiting, atomic writes, collection rules) into new clean implementations

### Path Management: Environment-Based Configuration
**Decision**: Use AICOS_BASE_DIR environment variable for portable base paths
**Rationale**: Eliminates hardcoded path dependencies that break across machines
**Implementation**: Single Config class validates all paths and credentials at startup

### Search Technology: SQLite FTS5
**Decision**: Use SQLite FTS5 instead of Elasticsearch or Whoosh
**Rationale**: Provides full-text search without operational complexity, highly portable
**Trade-offs**: Less advanced features than Elasticsearch, but sufficient for Phase 1

### Archive Strategy: Daily JSONL with Compression
**Decision**: Daily JSONL files with gzip compression, 90-day hot storage
**Rationale**: Balance between queryability and storage efficiency
**Benefits**: Append-only writes, easy backup/restore, compressed cold storage

### Error Recovery: Checkpoint System
**Decision**: Implement checkpoint/resume for all long-running operations
**Rationale**: Large data collections need resilience against partial failures
**Pattern**: Save progress at regular intervals, resume from last checkpoint

### API Resilience: Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Decision**: Add circuit breakers to all external API calls
**Rationale**: Prevent cascade failures when APIs become unavailable
**Implementation**: Track failure rates, open circuit after threshold, auto-recovery

### Testing Strategy: Mock-Based with Fixtures
**Decision**: Mock all external APIs, use fixture data for testing
**Rationale**: Avoid API quota consumption and flaky tests from external dependencies
**Approach**: Comprehensive fixture data covering edge cases and error scenarios

### Bounded Context Architecture
**Decision**: Isolate complex operations in bounded contexts
**Rationale**: Allows incremental migration and prevents architectural coupling
**Benefit**: Can evolve different parts of system independently
