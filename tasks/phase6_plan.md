# Phase 6: System Integration and Optimization (Revised)

## Executive Summary
Phase 6 takes an incremental approach to integrating core system components, focusing on realistic performance targets based on current system capabilities (326K records, lab-grade implementation). Priority on foundational integration rather than ambitious scaling.

## REVISED Phase 6 Objectives (Based on Critical Review)

### 6A: Foundational Integration (Reduced Scope)
**Goal**: Create basic integration between 2-3 core components with validated performance
- **Integration Point**: Phase 1 Slack collection → Phase 5 Slack intelligence → Results aggregation
- **Output**: Validated pipeline for Slack-only processing with monitoring
- **REALISTIC Performance Target**: Process 100-300 meetings with Slack enhancement in <30 minutes (10-15x current validated data volume)

### 6B: Performance Baseline and Monitoring  
**Goal**: Establish performance baselines and basic monitoring (not optimization)
- **Baseline Measurement**: Current system performance under 2x load with memory/CPU monitoring
- **Basic Monitoring**: Processing metrics, error rates, resource utilization tracking
- **REALISTIC Performance Target**: 80-85% Slack intelligence accuracy, <2s response time, <1GB memory usage

### 6C: Basic Error Recovery and Component Isolation
**Goal**: Implement basic error handling with partial success capabilities
- **Resilience**: Component isolation so failed components don't cascade, partial success modes
- **Error Handling**: Structured error classification, basic retry logic, manual override capabilities
- **REALISTIC Target**: 95% component isolation, graceful degradation when 1-2 components fail
