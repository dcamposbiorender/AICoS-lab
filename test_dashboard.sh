echo "=============================================="

echo "âœ… FIXES IMPLEMENTED:"

echo "  2. Fixed JavaScript button selectors"
echo "  3. Updated API endpoint URLs"
echo "  4. Added collection type handling and debugging"

echo "ðŸš€ TESTING PROCEDURE:"
echo ""
echo "Step 1: Start the backend server"
echo "  Run: ./start_backend.sh"
echo "  Expected: Server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8000"
echo "  Wait for: 'Application startup complete' message"
echo ""

echo "Step 2: Start the dashboard (in a new terminal)"  
echo "  Run: ./start_static_dashboard.sh"
echo "  Expected: Dashboard serves on http://127.0.0.1:3000"
echo "  Open: http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser"
echo ""

echo "Step 3: Open browser developer console"
echo "  Press F12 to open DevTools"
echo "  Go to Console tab"
echo "  Expected messages:"
echo "    - 'Setting up QUICK button event handler'"
echo "    - 'Setting up FULL button event handler'"
echo "    - 'Setting up REFRESH button event handler'"
echo ""

echo "Step 4: Test the buttons"
echo "  Click QUICK button:"
echo "    Console should show: 'QUICK button clicked'"
echo "    Console should show: 'Triggering quick collection...'"
echo "    Status should change from IDLE to COLLECTING"
echo "    Progress bar should show activity"
echo ""
echo "  Click FULL button:"
echo "    Console should show: 'FULL button clicked'"  
echo "    Console should show: 'Triggering full collection...'"
echo ""
echo "  Click REFRESH button:"
echo "    Console should show: 'REFRESH button clicked'"
echo "    WebSocket should reconnect"

echo "  Console should NOT show:"
echo "    - 'button not found' warnings"
echo "    - 'Failed to fetch' errors (if backend is running)"
echo "    - JavaScript errors"

echo "ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo "  - If buttons don't respond: Check console for selector errors"
echo "  - If API calls fail: Verify backend is running on port 8000"
echo "  - If CORS errors: Use ./start_static_dashboard.sh (not file://)"
