echo "ðŸ§ª Testing Streamlit Dashboard Button Fixes"
echo "=============================================="
echo ""

echo "âœ… FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "  1. Added onclick handlers to QUICK, FULL, REFRESH buttons"
echo "  2. Added JavaScript functions for button interactions"
echo "  3. Integrated backend API calls (localhost:8000)"
echo "  4. Added progress bar and status updates"
echo "  5. Added visual button feedback"
echo ""

echo "ðŸš€ TESTING PROCEDURE:"
echo ""
echo "Step 1: Start the Streamlit dashboard"
echo "  Run: ./start_dashboard.sh"
echo "  Expected: Streamlit starts on http://127.0.0.1:8501"
echo ""

echo "Step 2: Optional - Start backend (for full functionality)"  
echo "  Run in new terminal: ./start_backend.sh"
echo "  Expected: Backend API available on http://127.0.0.1:8000"
echo ""

echo "Step 3: Open dashboard in browser"
echo "  URL: http://127.0.0.1:8501"
echo "  Expected: Paper-dense dashboard loads"
echo ""

echo "Step 4: Open browser developer console"
echo "  Press F12 to open DevTools"
echo "  Go to Console tab"
echo ""

echo "Step 5: Test the buttons"
echo "  Click QUICK button:"
echo "    Console should show: 'Button clicked: QUICK'"
echo "    Console should show: 'Triggering quick collection...'"
echo "    Status should change from COLLECTING â†’ IDLE"
echo "    Progress bar should animate: 67% â†’ 10% â†’ 100% â†’ 67%"
echo ""
echo "  Click FULL button:"
echo "    Console should show: 'Button clicked: FULL'"  
echo "    Console should show: 'Triggering full collection...'"
echo "    Progress bar should animate similarly"
echo ""
echo "  Click REFRESH button:"
echo "    Console should show: 'Button clicked: REFRESH'"
echo "    Status should change to REFRESHING â†’ IDLE"
echo ""

echo "Step 6: Verify visual feedback"
echo "  Each button should flash blue when clicked"
echo "  Status text should change dynamically"
echo "  Progress bar should animate smoothly"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo "  - If buttons don't respond: Check browser console for JavaScript errors"
echo "  - If API calls fail: Backend not running (expected if not started)"
echo "  - If no visual feedback: Clear browser cache and reload"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“Š EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "  - Buttons are now clickable and provide immediate feedback"
echo "  - Progress bar animates during collection simulation"
echo "  - Status changes show system activity"
echo "  - Console logs show detailed operation tracking"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ The Streamlit dashboard should now be fully interactive!"
echo ""
echo "Press Enter to continue..."
