## Session Log

### [2025-08-15] - Project Setup and Documentation Review

#### What I tried:
- Creating GitHub repository and connecting local git
- Analyzing existing project documentation structure
- Fixing path inconsistencies in claude.md
- Creating development log template

#### What worked:
- Successfully created GitHub repository AICoS-lab
- Git initialization and remote connection completed
- Path dependencies in claude.md updated correctly
- Created vibe_log.md with proper template structure

#### What failed:
- Initially missed the "I UNDERSTAND THE ASSIGNMENT" requirement in claude.md
- First template format didn't match user's preferred structure

#### What I learned:
- Project has comprehensive documentation but zero implementation
- Strict workflow requirements: one task at a time, detailed documentation
- 4-layer architecture: Collection → Processing → Intelligence → Interface
- Local-first data storage approach is core to the design

#### "Aha" moments or dead ends:
- This project is in pure planning phase - need to move from documentation to implementation
- The workflow requirements are very structured but will help maintain quality
